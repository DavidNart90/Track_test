# Task 9 - Search Analytics

This task adds basic monitoring for search operations in the RAG system.

## Implemented Features

1. **SearchAnalytics class** (`src/trackrealties/analytics/search.py`)
   - Stores search execution logs in memory.
   - Records query text, chosen strategy, response time, and result count.
   - Provides aggregation methods to build a simple performance report.
2. **Integration with `EnhancedRAGPipeline`**
   - Each search request now logs analytics data including strategy used and response time.
3. **New API Endpoint** `/analytics/search-report`
   - Returns aggregated metrics from `SearchAnalytics.generate_performance_report()`.

## Usage

1. Perform searches using the existing `/rag/search` or `/rag/query` endpoints.
2. Retrieve analytics by calling `GET /analytics/search-report`.
   The response summarizes strategy usage, recent queries, and failed searches.

This functionality helps monitor search effectiveness and performance without requiring an external database.
