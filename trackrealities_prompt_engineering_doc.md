PROPERTY LISTINGS USAGE:
- Use for specific property recommendations and analysis
- Include property details, agent information, pricing history
- Reference days on market, price changes, comparable sales
- Example: "This property at 6808 Windrift Way shows strong value at $425K, especially considering..."

SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
Always connect micro (individual properties) with macro (market trends) insights.

## Sample Prompts and Responses

### 5.1 Investor Sample Interactions

**Sample Prompts:**
- "I have $500K to invest in rental properties in Texas. What markets should I target?"
- "Should I buy this property at 6808 Windrift Way in Austin for $425K as a rental investment?"
- "Compare the ROI potential between Austin and Dallas markets for single-family rentals"
- "What's the 5-year investment outlook for multifamily properties in Houston?"
- "I'm seeing negative cash flow on some properties - is this normal in today's market?"

**Sample Response: Investment Analysis**

üéØ **Investment Snapshot**
Austin presents a compelling opportunity with your $500K budget! The market shows 8.7% YoY price growth with healthy rental demand, though you'll want to focus on emerging areas for better cash flow potential.

üìä **Market Analysis** 
Based on our latest data from Travis County and surrounding areas:
- Median home price: $525K (up 8.7% YoY)
- Active inventory: 2,847 units (down 15.6% YoY) 
- Average days on market: 45 days
- Rental yield potential: 6-8% in target areas

The fundamentals look strong: Austin's population grew 2.4% last year driven by tech sector expansion, and rental demand remains robust with occupancy rates above 95% in most submarkets.

üí∞ **Financial Projections**
For a $425K property (like our example at 6808 Windrift Way):
- Down payment (20%): $85K
- Monthly mortgage: $2,156
- Estimated rental: $2,800
- Monthly cash flow: $344 (after taxes, insurance, maintenance)
- Cash-on-cash return: ~14.6%
- 5-year appreciation potential: 6-8% annually

‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Assessment** 
- Interest rate sensitivity: Rising rates could impact appreciation
- Market competition: Investor activity increasing, may compress yields
- Property taxes: Texas has higher property tax rates to consider

üéØ **Investment Strategy**
1. Target emerging neighborhoods like Del Valle, Riverside, or East Austin
2. Focus on 3BR/2BA single-family homes ($350K-450K range)
3. Consider properties needing light renovation for forced appreciation
4. Build relationships with wholesalers and off-market sources

üìã **Next Steps**
1. Get pre-approved for investment financing
2. Connect with property management company (I can recommend local firms)
3. Schedule viewings in target neighborhoods
4. Set up automated alerts for new listings matching your criteria

### 5.2 Developer Sample Interactions

**Sample Prompts:**
- "I'm looking at a 5-acre site in Austin for mixed-use development. Is this viable?"
- "What's the development potential for residential projects in North Dallas?"
- "Can you analyze the feasibility of a 200-unit apartment complex in San Antonio?"
- "What permits and approvals do I need for a commercial development in Houston?"
- "How long should I expect for the entire development process from land acquisition to completion?"

**Sample Response: Development Feasibility**

üèóÔ∏è **Development Overview**
This 5-acre site has excellent mixed-use potential! Based on current zoning and market conditions, you could develop 40-60 residential units plus 10K sqft retail - total project value around $18-22M.

üìç **Site Analysis**
The fundamentals look strong:
- Zoning: R-4 (Medium Density Residential) with commercial overlay potential
- Utilities: All major utilities at property line - saves ~$200K in infrastructure
- Access: Direct arterial road frontage + planned transit line within 0.5 miles
- Topography: Minimal grading needed, good drainage characteristics
- Environmental: Phase I clear, no wetlands or flood zone issues

üìà **Market Opportunity** 
Austin's growth story supports this development:
- Target demographic: 65% young professionals (25-40), 35% young families
- Absorption rate: 8-12 units/month based on comparable projects
- Retail demand: Underserved market - nearest grocery 2.3 miles away
- Competition: Only 2 similar projects planned within 3 miles
- Timing: Market cooling provides better construction costs, less competition

üíπ **Financial Feasibility**
Here's the preliminary pro forma:
- Total development cost: $16.8M (including land at $2.2M)
- Revenue projection: $22.1M (residential: $19.5M, retail: $2.6M)
- Gross profit margin: 24% (~$5.3M)
- Development timeline: 28 months from closing to stabilization
- Peak funding requirement: $12.5M (month 16)
- IRR potential: 18-22% (depends on pre-sales success)

üìã **Regulatory Path**
The approval process will require:
1. Site plan approval (6-8 months) - straightforward given zoning
2. Traffic impact study (required for 40+ units) - budget $45K
3. Environmental site assessment - already initiated
4. Utility coordination - ERCOT connection study needed
5. Building permits - parallel process during construction docs

üõ£Ô∏è **Implementation Roadmap**
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Due diligence, design development, city pre-submission
Phase 2 (Months 4-10): Permit approval, construction documents, financing
Phase 3 (Months 11-22): Construction (residential first, retail follows)
Phase 4 (Months 23-28): Marketing, lease-up, stabilization

**Critical Decision Points:**
- Month 6: Final permit approval confirmation
- Month 12: Construction financing commitment
- Month 18: Pre-sales target (60% minimum recommended)

### 5.3 Buyer Sample Interactions

**Sample Prompts:**
- "I'm looking for a 3-bedroom home under $400K in Austin with good schools nearby"
- "Should I buy now or wait for prices to come down in the Austin market?"
- "Compare these two properties: 6808 Windrift Way vs 114 Wolf Prairie in terms of value"
- "What neighborhoods in Austin offer the best value for first-time homebuyers?"
- "I found a house I love but it's been on the market for 120 days. What does that tell me?"

**Sample Response: Home Buying Guidance**

### Appendix C: Sample Code Implementations

**Role Detection Logic**
```python
def detect_user_intent(query: str, user_profile: dict) -> str:
    """Determine user role and intent from query and profile"""
    
    investment_keywords = ["roi", "cash flow", "rental", "investment", "yield"]
    development_keywords = ["development", "zoning", "permits", "feasibility"]
    buying_keywords = ["home", "house", "family", "schools", "neighborhood"]
    agent_keywords = ["listing", "marketing", "leads", "clients", "CMA"]
    
    query_lower = query.lower()
    scores = {
        "investor": sum(1 for kw in investment_keywords if kw in query_lower),
        "developer": sum(1 for kw in development_keywords if kw in query_lower),
        "buyer": sum(1 for kw in buying_keywords if kw in query_lower),
        "agent": sum(1 for kw in agent_keywords if kw in query_lower)
    }
    
    # Factor in user profile
    if user_profile.get("role"):
        scores[user_profile["role"]] += 2
    
    return max(scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
```

**Response Formatting**
```python
def format_response(content: dict, role: str) -> str:
    """Format response according to role-specific template"""
    
    role_emojis = {
        "investor": "üéØüìäüí∞‚ö†Ô∏èüéØüìã",
        "developer": "üèóÔ∏èüìçüìàüíπüìãüõ£Ô∏è", 
        "buyer": "üè°üåüüí∞üîçüìã‚úÖ",
        "agent": "üìäüéØüí°üìàüèÜüìã"
    }
    
    sections = role_emojis[role].split()
    formatted_sections = []
    
    for i, (section_key, emoji) in enumerate(zip(content.keys(), sections)):
        formatted_sections.append(f"{emoji} **{section_key.title()}**")
        formatted_sections.append(content[section_key])
        formatted_sections.append("")  # Empty line for spacing
    
    return "\n".join(formatted_sections)
```
