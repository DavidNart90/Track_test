# Task 3 Summary

This task adds hallucination detection to the TrackRealties project.

## Highlights

- Implemented **RealEstateHallucinationDetector** which flags unrealistic prices and percentages.
- Integrated the detector into **EnhancedRAGPipeline**. Generated responses are now synthesized and validated in one step.
- Updated **BaseAgent.run** to attach validation results from the pipeline and merge with any extra validator.
- Added unit tests for the new detector and updated existing agent tests to match the new pipeline interface.

## Usage

Call `EnhancedRAGPipeline.generate_response(query, context)` to obtain a response and its validation result. The returned `ValidationResult` includes any hallucination issues. `AgentResponse.validation_result` now contains this data after an agent call.
