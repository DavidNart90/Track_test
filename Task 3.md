# Task 3

This task introduces scripts and code updates for training and loading role specific language models.

## Changes Made
- Added `scripts/prepare_training_data.py` and `scripts/fine_tune_models.py` for generating datasets and fine tuning models.
- Implemented simple preprocessing and fine tuning utilities in `src/data_preparation.py` and `src/fine_tuning.py`.
- Extended `BaseAgent` to accept a `model_path` argument so agents can reference fineâ€‘tuned models.
- Updated all role agents to define default paths to their models.
- Created `create_agent` in `src/trackrealties/agents/factory.py` to load these paths and instantiate agents.
- Updated orchestrator and agent API route to use this factory function.
- Documented training instructions in `README.md`.

## Usage
1. Prepare datasets:
   ```bash
   python scripts/prepare_training_data.py
   ```
2. Fine tune the models:
   ```bash
   python scripts/fine_tune_models.py
   ```
   Models are stored in `models/{role}_llm/` and automatically loaded when agents are created.

# Task 3 Summary

This task adds hallucination detection to the TrackRealties project.

## Highlights

- Implemented **RealEstateHallucinationDetector** which flags unrealistic prices and percentages.
- Integrated the detector into **EnhancedRAGPipeline**. Generated responses are now synthesized and validated in one step.
- Updated **BaseAgent.run** to attach validation results from the pipeline and merge with any extra validator.
- Added unit tests for the new detector and updated existing agent tests to match the new pipeline interface.

## Usage

Call `EnhancedRAGPipeline.generate_response(query, context)` to obtain a response and its validation result. The returned `ValidationResult` includes any hallucination issues. `AgentResponse.validation_result` now contains this data after an agent call.

## Files Changed

- `src/trackrealties/validation/hallucination.py` (new)
- `src/trackrealties/validation/__init__.py`
- `rag_pipeline_integration.py`
- `src/trackrealties/agents/base.py`
- Tests: `test_agent_agent.py`, `test_buyer_agent.py`, `test_developer_agent.py`, `test_investor_agent.py`, `test_hallucination_detector.py` (new)
- `Task 3.md` (new)
